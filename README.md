# TaskerCanonBTRemote
Tasker automated canon bluetooth remote control
Developed on a Pixel 7 with GrapheneOS and Canon M50 with the Canon android ap as of 2024/10/19
The main goal of this script is to bypass the Canon limitation on 10 exposures of the camera onboard system.
So you are able to trigger many more exposures and much longer than 30s, very usefull in astrophotography.
